ChecklistBank Index Builder
---------------------------

This project exists solely to build the Solr search index for datasets from the registry. You can build an executable
jar using maven that will let you run the project closer to your checklistbank db.  Build the jar as follows:

mvn clean package assembly:single

That will produce a jar in your target dir named like checklistbank-index-2.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar.
Copy that to where you'd like to run it and run with (all on one line), pointing to a local checklistbank.properties
file that contains the setttings for the clb db and indexing configs:

java -jar checklistbank-index-builder-2.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar ./checklistbank.properties
