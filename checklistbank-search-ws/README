ChecklistBank Search Web services
---------------------------------

To run this Web service you need to provide connection details to a SOLR installation.

To do this you need to create a profile in your ~/.m2/settings.xml file. You can name it whatever you want but it must
have defined:

  * checklistbank.search.solr.server

An example profile could look like this:

    <profile>
      <id>clb-search</id>
      <properties>
        <checklistbank.search.solr.server>http://localhost:8080/checklistbank-solr</checklistbank.search.solr.server>
      </properties>
    </profile>

Then from the command line, run:

 * Command Line: mvn -P checklistbank-search jetty:run

*** Tests ***

There are no requirements in order to run the unit or integration tests.
It will use an embedded solr server with the shared index resource from checklistbank-index-builder to run the tests.
From the command line (with maven on your path), run:

 * Command Line: mvn clean verify
