ChecklistBank Search
---------------------

This project is the interface to a Solr server that can answer queries passed to it as SearchRequests (from the GBIF
API) and convert them to SolrJ queries that get passed to the Solr server. This project is just a thin layer over top
of the gbif-search project, and the bulk of the work is done by SolrSearchService from that project.

This project contains an integration test called NameUsageSearchIT that exercises the search process,
using a shared index resource that is generated by the checklistbank-solr project and an embedded Solr server.
